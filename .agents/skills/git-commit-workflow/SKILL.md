# Git Commit Workflow

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use the alternative when... |
|---|---|
| Designing the conventional-commit message and staging conventions for a repo | Use `git-commit` to actually create a commit (handles pre-commit hooks, issue detection) |
| Reviewing how to group changes logically into focused commits | Use `git-commit-trailers` for `BREAKING CHANGE` / `Co-authored-by` trailer rules |
| Discussing humble, fact-based commit communication style | Use `github-issue-autodetect` to add `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` links to messages |
| Authoring `feat(scope): subject` rules for your codebase | Use `github-pr-title` to apply the same conventional format to PR titles |

Expert guidance for commit message conventions, staging practices, and commit best practices using conventional commits and explicit staging workflows.

For detailed examples, advanced patterns, and best practices, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Preconditions

Before staging any files — especially for bulk-edit / commit-loop workflows that touch many subdirectories — verify the working tree is yours alone:

| Check | Why | How |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Coworker check | Another Claude session in the same checkout may have already pre-staged files (`git commit -a` retry, abandoned staging) that your loop would sweep into the wrong commit. **Run this up front, not opportunistically.** | `SlashCommand` → `/git:coworker-check` |
| Working tree scoped | Confirm `git status --porcelain` shows only your edits | `git status --porcelain` |

If `/git:coworker-check` returns anything other than `clear`, stop and either move to a fresh worktree (`git worktree add ../<repo>-<task>`) or ask the user before proceeding. See `.claude/rules/agent-coworker-detection.md` for the four detection signals.

## Core Expertise

- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized format for automation and clarity
- **Explicit Staging**: Always stage files individually with clear visibility
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related changes into focused commits
- **Communication Style**: Humble, factual, concise commit messages
- **Pre-commit Integration**: Run checks before committing

**Note:** Commits are made on main branch and pushed to remote feature branches for PRs. See **git-branch-pr-workflow** skill for the main-branch development pattern.

## Conventional Commit Format

### Standard Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

For footer/trailer patterns (Co-authored-by, BREAKING CHANGE, Release-As), see **git-commit-trailers** skill.

### Commit Types

- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc (no code change)
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without changing behavior
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, linter fixes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **ci**: CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
# Feature with scope
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 integration"

# Bug fix with body
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve null pointer in user service

Fixed race condition where user object could be null during
concurrent authentication requests."

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(api)!: migrate to GraphQL endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: REST endpoints removed in favor of GraphQL.
See migration guide at docs/migration.md"
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

**DO:**
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Be concise and factual
- **ALWAYS reference related issues** - every commit should link to relevant issues
- Use GitHub closing keywords: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`, `Resolves #789`
- Use `Refs #N` for related issues that should not auto-close
- Use lowercase for type and scope
- Be humble and modest

**DON'T:**
- Use past tense ("added" or "fixed")
- Include unnecessary details in subject line
- Use vague descriptions ("update stuff", "fix bug")
- Omit issue references - always link commits to their context
- Use closing keywords (`Fixes`) when you only mean to reference (`Refs`)

## Pre-Commit Context Gathering (Recommended)

Before committing, gather all context in one command:

```bash
# Basic context: status, staged files, diff stats, recent log
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-commit-workflow/scripts/commit-context.sh"

# With issue matching: also fetches open GitHub issues for auto-linking
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-commit-workflow/scripts/commit-context.sh" --with-issues
```

The script outputs: branch info, staged/unstaged status, diff stats, detected scopes, recent commit style, pre-commit config status, and optionally open issues. Use this output to compose the commit message. See [scripts/commit-context.sh](scripts/commit-context.sh) for details.

## Explicit Staging Workflow

### Always Stage Files Individually

```bash
# Show current status
git status --porcelain

# Stage files one by one for visibility
git add src/auth/login.ts
git add src/auth/oauth.ts
git status  # Verify what's staged

# Show what will be committed
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached  # Review actual changes

# Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 support"
```

## Bulk-edit / per-plugin commit loops

When a single change touches many subdirectories (per-plugin, per-package, per-doc) and each needs its own scoped commit for release-please, write a one-shot script rather than chaining commands inline.

### Why inline loops fail

| Pattern | What blocks it |
|---------|----------------|
| `for d in a b c; do git add "$d/" && git commit -m "..."; done` | `bash-antipatterns.sh` blocks `git add ... && git commit ...` — chaining index-modifying git commands risks an `index.lock` race condition |
| `git add -A`, `git add --all`, `git add .` | `bash-antipatterns.sh` blocks broad staging — sweeps in `.env`, large binaries, and **any coworker session's in-flight files** in a shared checkout (see `.claude/rules/agent-coworker-detection.md`) |
| Repeating `git add <paths>; git commit -m "..."` as separate Bash tool calls per plugin | Works, but ~3 tool calls × N plugins becomes hundreds of round-trips for a 40-plugin sweep |

### Canonical recipe

Write the loop to `/tmp/commit-loop-<slug>.sh`, then run it in **one** Bash call. The hook treats the file as a script, not a chain — index-modifying commands are sequential within bash, not racing through separate tool invocations.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /tmp/commit-loop-trim-descriptions.sh
set -uo pipefail
cd "$REPO_ROOT" || exit 1

for p in plugin-a plugin-b plugin-c; do
  # Skip plugins with nothing staged or modified inside them
  [ -z "$(git status --porcelain "$p/")" ] && continue

  git add "$p/skills/"            # explicit path, never -A or .
  git commit -m "docs($p): trim skill descriptions for listing budget"
done
```

Invoke once:

```bash
bash /tmp/commit-loop-trim-descriptions.sh
```

Each iteration runs pre-commit hooks and produces a clean per-plugin commit. Use `;` or newlines (not `&&`) between `git add` and `git commit` inside the script.

### Failure recovery

If the loop aborts mid-way (a pre-commit hook fails on plugin K of N), the commits for plugins 1..K-1 have **already landed** — they are not rolled back. Recovery rules:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Pre-commit hook caught a real issue in plugin K | Fix the issue, re-run the script — the `[ -z ... ] && continue` guard skips plugins with no remaining changes |
| Script re-run picks up plugin K's leftover staged paths | Good — the unstaged-or-staged check via `git status --porcelain "$p/"` catches both |
| You want to skip plugin K and continue | Edit the script to remove plugin K from the list, re-run |

Do **not** re-stage paths that already committed cleanly; `git status` is the source of truth for what's left.

**Compose a multi-line message with a HEREDOC, not by slurping a temp file.**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support

Implements token refresh and secure storage.

Fixes #123
EOF
)"
```

Passing the message **by path** is equally accepted — `git commit -F <file>` /
`--file=<file>` is git's analogue of `gh --body-file`, and the
`bash-antipatterns` hook exempts it (#2462):

```bash
git commit -F /tmp/commit-msg.txt
```

What the hook still nudges away from is the roundabout middle ground: writing a
temp file and then slurping it back through `-m "$(cat /tmp/commit-msg.txt)"`.
Either compose inline with a heredoc, or pass the file by path.

## Communication Style

### Humble, Fact-Based Messages

```bash
# Good: Concise, factual, modest
git commit -m "fix(auth): handle edge case in token refresh"

git commit -m "feat(api): add pagination support

Implements cursor-based pagination for list endpoints.
Includes tests and documentation."
```

Focus on facts: **What changed**, **Why it changed** (if non-obvious), and **Impact** (breaking changes).

## Issue Reference Summary

| Scenario | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Bug fix resolving issue | `Fixes #N` | `Fixes #123` |
| Feature completing issue | `Closes #N` | `Closes #456` |
| Related but not completing | `Refs #N` | `Refs #789` |
| Cross-repository | `Fixes owner/repo#N` | `Fixes org/lib#42` |
| Multiple issues | Repeat keyword | `Fixes #1, fixes #2` |

## Best Practices

### Commit Frequency

- **Commit early and often**: Small, focused commits
- **One logical change per commit**: Easier to review and revert
- **Keep commits atomic**: Each commit should be a complete, working state

### Commit Message Length

```bash
# Subject line: <= 72 characters
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support

# Body: <= 72 characters per line (wrap)
# Use blank line between subject and body
```

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Pre-commit context | `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-commit-workflow/scripts/commit-context.sh"` |
| Context + issues | `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-commit-workflow/scripts/commit-context.sh" --with-issues` |
| Quick status | `git status --porcelain` |
| Staged diff stats | `git diff --cached --stat` |
| Recent commit style | `git log --format='%s' -5` |
| Open issues for linking | `gh issue list --state open --json number,title --limit 30` |
